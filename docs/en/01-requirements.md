# Requirements and Installation

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have:

-   **Node.js** version 16 or higher.
-   A development environment that supports **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** (for example, Visual Studio Code).
-   For browser-based games: any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

## Installation

### Install from npm

You can install Angry Pixel Engine directly from npm using the following command:

```bash
npm install angry-pixel
```

The engine includes its own type definitions, so no additional type packages are needed for TypeScript.

### Using the project skeleton

If you prefer to start with a pre-configured project structure, you can use the official skeleton:

```bash
npx degit angry-pixel-studio/angry-pixel-skeleton my-game
cd my-game
npm install
```

This will create a new project with a recommended structure and an initial setup ready to use.
