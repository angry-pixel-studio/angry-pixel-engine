# Angry Pixel Engine

**Angry Pixel Engine** is an open-source 2D game engine developed in TypeScript. It is designed to simplify game development using a modern **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture, offering a flexible and highly modular structure.

## Key Features

-   **Entity-Component-System** architecture.
-   Fully written in **TypeScript**, compatible with both **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** projects without requiring additional type packages.
-   Three-phase game loop: decoupled logic, physics, and rendering.
-   19 built-in components covering physics, rendering, and interaction.
-   Extensible system: supports custom components and systems.
-   Includes a math library (vectors, rectangles, and common utilities).
-   Compatible with keyboard, mouse, gamepads, and touch screens.
-   Integrated scene management and asset handling.

## Who is it for?

Angry Pixel Engine is ideal for:

-   Indie developers and small studios seeking a flexible 2D engine.
-   Programmers who value a clear and extensible ECS architecture.
-   Educational projects or rapid prototyping.
-   Browser-based game development, as it is very easy to integrate with HTTP and WebSocket calls.

## Project Status

The engine is currently under **active development** and is **stable** for production use.

## License

Angry Pixel Engine is **open-source** and distributed under the **MIT license**, allowing free use in both commercial and personal projects.
